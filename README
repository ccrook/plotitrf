Small PyQt program for displaying the difference between different ITRF realisations at different epochs.

itrfdata.py Generates a data set (already included as plotitrf.dat).  This uses the concord program to calculate the ITRF data. 
Note that this is using the IGS parameters for the ITRF97-ITRF97 transformation.

plotitrf.py Plots the data 

QtWorld.py Python module for displaying the vector data on a world map or globe

coast.dat Very simple world coastline data
plotitrf.dat Pre-calculated ITRF data.  (Calculated on points of a stellated dodecahedron (or icosahedron)

Currently running with python 2.7 and PyQt4 version 4.9.1
